# Dotfiles

A config file repo like many other repos, not too deep but copied, customised and saved in a central repo according to my needs.

## This repo contains the Configs.. But for what?

- i3 (window manager) - Contributed by Kumar Aditya.
- htop (memory viewer and manager) - Copied from distrotube and modified by me.
- vim (a **Nerdy** text editor) - Copied from websites and modified by me.
- `.bashrc` - Bash config file for my use case.
- `.zshrc` - Zsh config file, without Oh-My-ZSH
  - `.zshrc.with-oh-my-zsh-config` - ZSH config file, with some of my modifications to default Oh-My-ZSH config.
- alacritty - Configurations in YAML file for alacritty terminal emulator
- VS Code - Configurations, Extensions, Keybindings, and custom settings for VSCode. Configured for most of the projects I have done on, or I would be doing.

## Configs to add in future..
