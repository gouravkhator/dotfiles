# Dotfiles

A config file repo like many other repos, not too deep but copied, customised and saved in a central repo according to my needs.

## This repo contains the Configs.. But for what?

- i3 (window manager) - Contributed by Kumar Aditya.
- htop (memory viewer and manager) - Copied from distrotube and modified by me.
- vim (a **Nerdy** text editor) - Copied from websites and modified by me.
- .bashrc - Default bashrc config in manjaro with my modifications
- .ubuntu_bashrc - Default bashrc config in ubuntu with my modifications

## Configs to add in future..

- Rofi - A program launcher
