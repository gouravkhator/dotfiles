# Dotfiles

A config file repo like many other repos, not too deep but copied, customised and saved in a central repo according to my needs.

## Config for Which Types of Files?

* i3 (window manager) - Contributed by Kumar Aditya.
* htop (memory viewer and manager) - Copied from distrotube and modified by me.
* vim (a **Nerdy** text editor) - Copied from websites and modified by me.
