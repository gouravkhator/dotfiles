# The Post Installation Guide for your Linux Install

My distro of choice is **Fedora** with **Gnome** desktop environment, as on 7th July 2022. I provided the date, as I am even unsure if I would distro-hop in future ðŸ˜œ.

## Must-Have for Any Distro

### GUI applications that I mostly install and/or use:

- Google Chrome
- VS Code (the one I am using for making this repo as well..)
- Alacritty Terminal Emulator
- Zsh Shell and on top of Zsh, install `Oh-My-Zsh` too, to make it cooler and way fancier.
  - Install Zsh and set it up
  - Change the default shell to Zsh.
  - Install `Oh-My-Zsh` to make it fancier and way more functional by default.
- VLC: The best **open-source** Video and Audio Player.
- FileZilla: Amazing FTP client

### CLI-only applications/packages:

- Vim (An awesome Text editor): Install it if not available..
- Neofetch: An awesome *init* command for any shell of your choice.
- Exa: A good `ls` alternative.
- Breeze icon theme: Package name is `breeze-icon-theme`.

## For Developers

Below are the ones, which I as a developer, keep in my installed set of tools:

- Rust
- JDK (Java Development Kit)
- NodeJS
- Python: LOL, it already forms major part of linux packages. It is already pre-installed mostly.
- Postman: Used for API Testing
- Docker: Optional Usage for my use-case.
