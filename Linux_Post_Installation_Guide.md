# The Post Installation Guide for your Linux Install

My distro of choice is **Fedora** with **Gnome** desktop environment, as on 7th July 2022. I provided the date, as I am even unsure if I would distro-hop in future ðŸ˜œ.

## GUI applications that I mostly install and/or use:

- Google Chrome
- VS Code (the one I am using for making this repo as well..)
- Alacritty Terminal Emulator
- Postman: Used for API testing
- VLC: The best open source Video and Audio Player. 
- FileZilla: Amazing FTP client

## CLI-only applications/packages:

- JDK (Java Development Kit)
- Rust
- NodeJS
- Vim (An awesome Text editor): Install it if not available..
- Neofetch: An awesome init command for any shell of your choice. 
- Exa: A good `ls` alternative
- Breeze icon theme: Package name is `breeze-icon-theme`.
